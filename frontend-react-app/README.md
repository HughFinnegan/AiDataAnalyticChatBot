# React and Vite + how to run code

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**To make the code run: **
1. on terminal (in frontend-react-app folder): npm install
2. npm run dev
3. a link will appear with the local host
4. copy and paste it on a browser
5. save file and refresh browser to see changes

note: to run with backend you need to split the terminal and make the backend run on one terminal and the frontend on the other
